# ✈️ Flight Trip Planner

A console and GUI-based application that computes optimal travel routes between cities under realistic flight constraints such as layovers, budget, and travel time.

## 🚀 Features

- Optimize routes by:
  - Minimum number of flights
  - Minimum total fare
  - Balanced cost-time trade-off
- Handles:
  - Layover time constraints
  - Fare limits and time windows
- GUI built with Tkinter for interactive route planning

## 🧠 Algorithms & Data Structures

- Graph modeling of cities and flights
- Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- Priority Queues (Min-Heap)
- Adjacency List representation

## 🖥️ GUI

The Tkinter-based interface allows users to:
- Enter source and destination
- Choose optimization goal
- Visualize suggested routes

## 🔧 Usage

```bash
python flight_planner.py
